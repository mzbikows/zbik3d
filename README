Zbik3D is a graphical multi-robot simulation environment. It was a part of my Engineering Thesis. The subject of my Engineering Thesis was the design and implementation of a graphical multi-robot simulation environment. Zbik3D is a client application simulating the operation of a group of manipulators. The application was written in C++, using OpenGL library. The server is based around MRROC++ system, providing joints information for each manipulator, with data transmission between client and server applications carried out via UDP. The application will allow MROC++ operation simulation, including manipulator visualization, without the need for real robots. An important element of the implementation is the ability to record and retrieve robot trajectory information from an external file. More information you can find on project website:
